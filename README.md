# Visualisation-of-DHCP
In order to assign an IP address automatically to the client through DHCP server and to visualize the states occurring in the process.
To Visualize different state transitions that happen as part of DHCP protocol and how the IP address is assigned to client from DHCP Server along with various parameters.

Input: Packet Capture of DHCP

Objective:

The implementation of a DHCP server minimizes the errors related to the configuration of Internet Protocol(IP) addresses manually and to configure the DHCP server and administer on clients and servers.

A DHCP Server is a network server that automatically provides and assigns IP addresses, default gateways and other network parameters to client devices.
